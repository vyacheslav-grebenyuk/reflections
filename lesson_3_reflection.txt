When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      When I want to share my project with other people to show my results or to contribute
      together.
      
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
      Forks is a copy of repository at GitHub made by another contributor for his/her own goals.
      It doesn't connect to the original project.
      Clones is local or remote copies of repository in one contributor profile. They can be synchronized.
      Branches are the different lines of evolution of one repository.
      When I want to start some new project based on the existing one by another contributor
      I have to fork.
      Cloning is for synchronizing my repositories at different working places (computers).
      Branching is for introducing some another (different or experimental) ideas to current
      repository (project).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
      It is neccessary for having no problems with merging commits stored local and remote
      in case of many contributors work with the same branch
